# About

## What is this website about?

This website serves as a collection of resources and learning materials that I'm updating over time so that I may find them later if needed but also to publicly provide resources for others that may be useful.

## Why was this website made?

I want to share what I learn so I thought this was a good way of doing so! I've been posting resources in a private community as I hadn't had the time to make a public website for them (until now!).

Also I wanted to practice using Next.js so that I may use it for certain current and future projects.

## Who is developing this website?

I'm Mueez and as of 2023 I'm currently an undergraduate computer science student.

## What can I learn here?

There's [plenty of resources you can explore](/resources)!

## Can I contribute to this website?

If you'd like to contribute to the website feel free to do so at [the website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/rzmk/learn.mueezkhan.com).
